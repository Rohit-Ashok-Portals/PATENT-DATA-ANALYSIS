🚀 Unveiling My Latest Data Analysis Project: Electric Vehicle Patent Landscaping 🌍

Over the past few weeks, I embarked on an exciting journey to analyze a dataset of 100k electric vehicle patents, uncovering insights into global innovation trends and competitive landscapes. Here's a glimpse into what I achieved:

✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation: Transformed raw data by cleaning columns, promoting headers, and creating unique identifiers using Power BI.

📊 Interactive Dashboard: Developed KPIs like Total Patents, Grant Rate (33.49%), and Pending/Granted/Expired Patents (33k each).

🌏 Global Patent Trends: Identified China & Germany as leaders with 12.7k patents each, followed by the USA and Japan.

⚙️ Technology Insights: Highlighted top technologies like Powertrain Technology (16.79k patents) and year-wise trends with peaks in 1990 and 2023.

🏢 Top Assignees: Analyzed key players like Lucid Motors (7.08k patents) and others such as Panasonic, General Motors, and Hyundai Motors.

🔗 Comprehensive Visualizations: Pie charts, treemaps, line charts, bar charts, and matrix tables showcasing trends and insights.

This project gave me invaluable insights into patent landscaping and how it aids M&A decisions and innovation strategies.
